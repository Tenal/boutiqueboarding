With extensive animal care experience, including working as a dog trainer and serving in various capacities within shelters, grooming facilities, vet clinics, and dog daycares, I've gained valuable expertise in caring for dogs of all sizes and temperaments. Rescue work has also been a consistent driving force in my life; I have spent nearly a decade fostering and volunteering with rescues, much of that with my partner, Ryan."

        "body": "We offer boutique, in-home boarding for anyone looking for a \"home away from home\" alternative to kennels. To ensure each dog receives the attention they deserve, we typically only board one dog at a time, as we often have a foster dog in our home. This allows us to prioritize individualized attention and focus on meeting every dog's mental and physical needs to ensure a balanced, fulfilled, and enriching environment. With the flexibility of being full-time work-from-home professionals, we can offer your furry family member companionship and structured care all day."
