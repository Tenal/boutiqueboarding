        "review": "Our daughter recommended we board our dog with Tenal, being familiar with her training experience, love of dogs, and work fostering rescues with behavioural challenges. Our boy Archer, a rescue who sings arias when frustrated, had a wonderful stay with Tenal. How do we know? Tenalâ€™s photos, video clips, and updates showed us that Archer was getting lots of exercise, both physical and mental, and exposure to many new enrichment activities (a number of which weâ€™ve already adopted). Further, <b>Tenal and her partner Ryan seemed to treat Archer like he was their own dog, which meant he wasnâ€™t short on much-loved cuddles. Archer came home tired, calmer, and happy. All in all, we learned a lot from Tenal during Archerâ€™s 7-day stay</b>, his first-ever boarding since we adopted him just under 2 years ago. We live four hours away, but without hesitation, we would board Archer with Tenal again. In fact, we're sure Archer is dreaming of his next stay!"

        "review": "From the moment we first met Tenal we knew our little Lou would be in the safest pair of hands - which is exactly what every pet parent wants when they go away. As first time boarders, we knew we wanted someone who would have the time, energy, and patience to look after Louis while we were away. <b>Tenal went above and beyond - taking the time to understand Louis, his needs, and how to keep him busy and engaged</b> for two weeks. Her check-ins were amazing, and we could tell from afar just how much he was enjoying his time. We would highly recommend Tenal to anyone looking to board their pup - not only will they leave just as happy and healthy as you left them - but you'll also have peace of mind that they're in a loving and caring environment throughout their stay. Thanks for taking care of our little guy, Tenal! We're still so grateful! He'll definitely be back :)"

        "review": "Our experience with Tenal caring for Loki was beyond our expectations. Loki is a rescue and had a really rough start and can be nervous in new situations and she took so much time and care in making him comfortable. Not only was he able to be comfortable in their care, it is clear that he felt completely safe and loved with Tenal and Ryan. Tenal really took the time to understand his needs, and provided him with a great deal of engagement and care. I also really enjoyed following along with how Loki was doing via  the Instagram page. <b>It provided me so much comfort and joy to see him thriving while I was away on vacation. I cannot recommend this service enough</b> and needless to say, Loki will be back for all our future travel."

Aurelio is a big, excitable bully breed and she ensures he gets enough enrichment and manages his big personality. I would recommend boutique boarding to anyone looking for a safe and fun place for their dog!"

We knew Koda was in a safe and happy place. We have found a safe and happy place for our next holidays or daycare. Thanks a million Tenal ðŸ˜Š"

She is not only patient with him but teaches him a lot of really useful skills while keeping him busy and entertained.</b> She also provides numerous updates while our dog is in her care and we always feel like our dog is getting a lot of love from her. It is very apparent how much she loves dogs. I would not hesitate to recommend Tenal for any dog sitting needs. Thanks Tenal for all you do for us when we need you. Finally found a place to leave Bower where he gets the care we want for him."

He had a rocky trial night, but we hoped (prayed!) after implementing a few of Tenalâ€™s suggestions, that he would do well for his week with Boutique Boarding while we moved houses. I am happy to report that it was a great success! <b>We excitedly checked Instagram every day for updates and beautiful photos of our boy. We could see his progress in real time which made it possible to relax</b> and focus on our move. Tenal and Ryan worked together to welcome Mowgli into their family and this made all the difference!"

We have boarded him a couple of times with them since adopting him over a year ago. <b>They are the absolute best, from the photo and video updates to giving advice and guiding us in the right direction for training tools for our very leash reactive pup.</b> The attentiveness and engagement they give all the dogs that have been in their care is unmatched! The experience and knowledge that boutique boarding has is what helps them stand out from other boarding services, they will always be our #1 choice if we need our boy taken care of. He comes home a happy, healthy, tired guy and we canâ€™t be more appreciative of boutique boarding and their fantastic services. Keeping your pup mentally and physically fulfilled while you are not with them is the priority! "

        "review": "If I could give more than a 5-star review, I would do it in a heartbeat. Tenal has been nothing short of extraordinary in caring for Dakota. Her attention to detail and commitment to maintaining Dakota's routines, from walking in a \"heel\" to going to her \"place\" on the mat, have been impeccable. What sets Tenal apart is her ability to make sure Dakota isn't just well-looked after, but genuinely happy and thriving. The regular updates with beautiful photos and videos are great comfort to us. It's heartwarming to see Dakota so content and enjoying her time while being boarded. <b>Tenal's professionalism and affection for the pets she cares for are evident in every interaction. Tenal has mastered the art of providing a dog with structure and love at the same time.</b> I wholeheartedly recommend Tenal for both day-sitting and boarding."

From the moment we met Tenal we knew she was in great hands. Tenal was very thorough about what the process was like and the structure of each day. She was very considerate of the training we wanted to continue and incorporated her own improvements to Rooneyâ€™s habits + wellbeing during her stay. It is clear she has a very special way with dogs and extremely knowledgeable about their needs. Throughout our trip, she posted daily updates which kept us happy and excited about Rooneys stay with her. Rooney also had a reoccurring eye infection and Tenal was quick to let us know and provide the care Rooney needed. Along with updates, <b>her tips and tricks are something we will continue to do at home with Rooney - she came back a happy and healthy puppy, we couldnâ€™t have asked for a better experience.</b> We will definitely use Tenal again for any future boarding!"
