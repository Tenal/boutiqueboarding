As first time boarders, we knew we wanted someone who would have the time, energy, and patience to look after Louis while we were away. <b>Tenal went above and beyond - taking the time to understand Louis, his needs, and how to keep him busy and engaged</b> for two weeks. Her check-ins were amazing, and we could tell from afar just how much he was enjoying his time. We would highly recommend Tenal to anyone looking to board their pup - not only will they leave just as happy and healthy as you left them - but you'll also have peace of mind that they're in a loving and caring environment throughout their stay. Thanks for taking care of our little guy, Tenal! We're still so grateful! He'll definitely be back :)"

        "review": "Tenal has taken care of my rescue dog Aurelio many times (including fostering him before I met him!) and I am so happy he has such a good place to go when I am away. <b>She is extremely diligent and careful, and she goes above expectations to understand Aurelioâ€™s specific needs to ensure that he has a safe and enriching stay</b> when boarding with her. Aurelio is a big, excitable bully breed and she ensures he gets enough enrichment and manages his big personality. I would recommend boutique boarding to anyone looking for a safe and fun place for their dog!"

She was very well organized and thorough with her expectations and itinerary of Kodaâ€™s boarding stay. <b>We went with her after our meet and greet, as we saw her bio, with her experience, knowledge and her sincere love for what she does</b>! We knew Koda was in a safe and happy place. We have found a safe and happy place for our next holidays or daycare. Thanks a million Tenal ðŸ˜Š"
