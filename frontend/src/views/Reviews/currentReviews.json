        "review": "Our daughter recommended we board our dog with Tenal, being familiar with her training experience, love of dogs, and work fostering rescues with behavioural challenges. Our boy Archer, a rescue who sings arias when frustrated, had a wonderful stay with Tenal. How do we know? Tenalâ€™s photos, video clips, and updates showed us that Archer was getting lots of exercise, both physical and mental, and exposure to many new enrichment activities (a number of which weâ€™ve already adopted). Further, <b>Tenal and her partner Ryan seemed to treat Archer like he was their own dog, which meant he wasnâ€™t short on much-loved cuddles. Archer came home tired, calmer, and happy. All in all, we learned a lot from Tenal during Archerâ€™s 7-day stay</b>, his first-ever boarding since we adopted him just under 2 years ago. We live four hours away, but without hesitation, we would board Archer with Tenal again. In fact, we're sure Archer is dreaming of his next stay!"

        "review": "From the moment we first met Tenal we knew our little Lou would be in the safest pair of hands - which is exactly what every pet parent wants when they go away. As first time boarders, we knew we wanted someone who would have the time, energy, and patience to look after Louis while we were away. <b>Tenal went above and beyond - taking the time to understand Louis, his needs, and how to keep him busy and engaged</b> for two weeks. Her check-ins were amazing, and we could tell from afar just how much he was enjoying his time. We would highly recommend Tenal to anyone looking to board their pup - not only will they leave just as happy and healthy as you left them - but you'll also have peace of mind that they're in a loving and caring environment throughout their stay. Thanks for taking care of our little guy, Tenal! We're still so grateful! He'll definitely be back :)"

        "review": "Our experience with Tenal caring for Loki was beyond our expectations. Loki is a rescue and had a really rough start and can be nervous in new situations and she took so much time and care in making him comfortable. Not only was he able to be comfortable in their care, it is clear that he felt completely safe and loved with Tenal and Ryan. Tenal really took the time to understand his needs, and provided him with a great deal of engagement and care. I also really enjoyed following along with how Loki was doing via  the Instagram page. <b>It provided me so much comfort and joy to see him thriving while I was away on vacation. I cannot recommend this service enough</b> and needless to say, Loki will be back for all our future travel."

Aurelio is a big, excitable bully breed and she ensures he gets enough enrichment and manages his big personality. I would recommend boutique boarding to anyone looking for a safe and fun place for their dog!"

She was very well organized and thorough with her expectations and itinerary of Kodaâ€™s boarding stay. <b>We went with her after our meet and greet, as we saw her bio, with her experience, knowledge and her sincere love for what she does</b>! We knew Koda was in a safe and happy place. We have found a safe and happy place for our next holidays or daycare. Thanks a million Tenal ðŸ˜Š"

She is not only patient with him but teaches him a lot of really useful skills while keeping him busy and entertained.</b> She also provides numerous updates while our dog is in her care and we always feel like our dog is getting a lot of love from her. It is very apparent how much she loves dogs. I would not hesitate to recommend Tenal for any dog sitting needs. Thanks Tenal for all you do for us when we need you. Finally found a place to leave Bower where he gets the care we want for him."

He had a rocky trial night, but we hoped (prayed!) after implementing a few of Tenalâ€™s suggestions, that he would do well for his week with Boutique Boarding while we moved houses. I am happy to report that it was a great success! <b>We excitedly checked Instagram every day for updates and beautiful photos of our boy. We could see his progress in real time which made it possible to relax</b> and focus on our move. Tenal and Ryan worked together to welcome Mowgli into their family and this made all the difference!"
