While boarding dogs are unsupervised, they will be crated. This includes crating overnight and occasional crating during the day if we are both out of the house. <p>Subject to any dietary restrictions, stuffed frozen Kong's or other durable toys are given regularly to help encourage a more positive and relaxed crating experience.</p>"

While dog parks can be fun and social at times, they can also be unpredictable and do not allow us to prioritize the safety and well-being of your dog. We also don’t allow interactions with any dogs not in our care and avoid all on-leash greetings."
